the long-term limit list is 9 because at 10 signs the normal, 1-sign compression is more efficient in most of the cases
 (noone would create an image with a abcdefghij sequence repeating itself at least 5 times)   
currently, the limit is 5 for efficiency reasons
 however, you can still activate the includeComb6 statemente while compressing
 but be aware that this will cost some time for making the comb6 list
the combX_ lists are lists with also elements like aaa
 which must not be in the combX lists but must be part of the list1/2 elements for new combX lists
